JAAsyncQueue

JAAsyncQueue implements a simple asynchronous object queue for Cocoa. Objects
may be enqueued from any thread, and any number of objects can dequeue objects.
Dequeues can be either blocking (suspending the thread until data is available)
or non-blocking (returning nil if no data is available).

I have used this pattern several times in the past to implement background
worker threads. In general, I recommend using Grand Central Dispatch instead
for new development.
